The challenge is to recreate the "anoceanofsky" website on React-Native. The image at the top should either remain as an ImageBackground with a Play button (which would open up a modal) over it OR it should be replaced by the static image of a video. Besides being able to access the video from where the image is: You should also make it such that a Modal will open up when one of the links in the top NavBar is clicked. Make sure one of the links says "PlayVideo" and is connected to a function which will open up a Modal containing a video.
